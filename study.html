        <h2>Aircon Woes (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )</h2>
        <p>If I had a dollar for everytime I took apart an aircon, I'd have two, which isnt much, but its weird that it happened twice.<br><br>
      So yeah school has once again started and the first thing I'm hit with is a terrible sore throat which then developed into a full blown cough. So I thought, huh, thats really unlucky that everytime I'm back in hall I'm always hit with a really bad flu. Because when I thought back to it I ended up with the flu so many times over the course of the previous year. So I'm just thinking, Oh! Maybe its just me being really unlucky and so I think nothing about it.<br><br>
      And so the weekend goes by, I get home and my flu gets noticeably better. I feel great by the time Sunday rolls about and I go back to my dorm and head to bed thinking about what a great week this week's gonna be.<br><br>
      BOOM I wake up with the worst cough+sore throat combination I've felt in awhile, and a bit of a fever to go with it. And I'm just thinking: Just what is it that's causing me to be so sick?<br><br>
      Then it hits me - I haven't cleaned the portable aircon ONCE since getting it and there's probably a ton of mould in there.<br><br>
      AND YES THERE REALLY WAS A LOT OF MOULD I SPENT THE BETTER HALF OF AN ENTIRE DAY TAKING APART THE AIRCON AND PAINSTAKINGLY CLEANING IT BIT BY BIT OH MY LORD IT WASN'T EVEN A LAYER OF MOULD IT WAS A FULL ON BROWNIE OF MOULD IN THERE NO WONDER WHY I KEPT FALLING SICKKKK<br><br>
      But well that's that I now have a spanking clean aircon which should hopefully be much more colder than it already was. (I also have two screws which I couldn't find the hole they belonged so oh well)<br><br>
      And so for the rest of the month I suppose I'm gonna be testing my hypothesis of whether my aircon really was the problem (I really hope it was because I coughed so much my lungs have started to hurt ughhhh)<br><br>
      Anyway for the uninitiated heres how an aircon looks when you tear it apart.</p>

      <h2>Cat Cafe!! ≽^•⩊•^≼</h2>
      <p>So recently I went to a cat cafe called Catonomy in Penang and met the most friendly cats I've seen in awhile they were legit sooooo charming. It was located around a 10 minutes walk from my accomodation in Georgetown, so I think it was pretty convenient to get to! This was my second time visiting a cat cafe so I was wondering how it'd go this time, because the last time I went to one the cafe was so small and the cats were all so stressed that they were completely disinterested in interacting with humans which was quite disappointing to see D:<br><br> So when I stepped into the cafe I was happy to see that it took up the entirety of a shophouse and was really big, with a 2nd floor for the cats to go to when (presumably) they were done for the day. The cats were all very friendly and used to humans so it was really nice. Plus, the entry fee was buying a meal/drink from them, and I ordered the Kaarage Don from them at only ~RM20 which was such a steal! It was hella fun, 10/10 would go again if I ever were to go back to Penang.
      <br><br>
      Notable cats: Super affectionate Ragdoll (no vid cuz it left to go upstairs), 2 young Tuxedoes (pickupable), and Boba Eyes<br>
