        <h3 class="text-center">Craving external validation because I use other people’s benchmarks to measure myself.</h3>
        <p class="p2">
          I’ve often found myself asking people questions on what they were up to, not out of a place of genuine interest in them, but more out of a desire to gather information so that I could place myself amongst my peers. I’ve constantly sought out validation by hitting the benchmarks my peers deemed important to hit, so I could tell myself that I was “ahead of the curve”, because that meant that I was doing alright.

<br><br>But really, the only thing I was doing to myself was just stripping myself of my own confidence. Telling myself that because the majority of my peers were doing something, it must be the right path, the path that I too have to take if I want to be considered a successful person. Subjecting myself to the endless rat race that was trying to be above average.

<br><br>This manifested in me having multiple breakdowns over the semester over trying to face the fact that I couldn’t bring myself to try to even hit them. This line of thought really made me feel like a failure. I wasn’t putting half as much effort as many of them, nor did I have many “productive” things to show for it. Side projects, a side hustle, etc.

<br><br>Nonetheless, I pushed myself to try many new things, in order to feel like I could catch up with them by having something of my own to show off. This helped me gain more experiences to draw conclusions from.

<br><br>And really, the biggest conclusion I’ve formed was that there was no need to keep using the same yardstick that everyone else was using. Just because I wasn’t following the conventional path doesn’t mean that I was going to be behind anyone else. 

<br><br>There isn’t a right path, nor is it possible to be ahead or behind. There’s just the path I’m taking.

<br><br>With these new experiences I’ve had, I was able to start to separate the things which sparked joy from the things which drained it, and bit by bit, I was able to piece together an idea of a life which would make me happy. And instead of keeping it as merely an idea, I started to live it.

<br><br>I prioritised my own enjoyment of life, time with myself without distractions, a life without the pressure of constantly needing to be productive.

<br><br>By embodying the life I wanted to lead, it allowed me to build trust that there wasn’t anything wrong about the way I wanted to lead my life, that by changing my long ingrained habits and beliefs, it wouldn’t cause a catastrophic impact on the things which truly mattered to me. 

<br><br>This trust allowed me to start believing in my own opinions on things, allowing me to greatly scale down my need for external validation to make my own decisions.

<br><br>I recently had a conversation with a few friends about what they were doing to further their professional careers. I still spiraled a bit after that conversation, as I fell back to my old habit of measuring myself using their benchmark causing a mini panic attack. But I was able to ground myself, and once again trust that there wasn’t anything I had to change just because I gathered some new information through that conversation. I didn’t have to act on it. I just had to receive it.

<br><br>So have more faith in yourself. Trust that you know what’s best for you. 

<br><br>And if you currently don’t, go outside and try things. Make changes. Figure out what sparks joy. Then act to build that trust in that feeling.
