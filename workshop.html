        <h2>Intentional inconvenience ( ╹ -╹)?</h2>

        <p class="text-center">The phone's completely obscured</p>
        <p class="p2">I've made it just that much more annoying to access my phone. My phone’s typically always on the table, always in sight. Whenever I get bored while doing work, I look around me and it’s the first distraction I see. So naturally, I pick it up and there goes at least half an hour. I decided to create a mental hoop I'd have to jump through to get to my phone.
          <br><br>Out of sight, out of mind, they say. When I put my phone away, I cease to think about it, and more often than not I actually end up forgetting where I put it away at. When I do get bored of whatever I’m doing and find something else to do, my attention is usually given to the other hobbies I have, like my guitar that stands right next to my table.
          <br><br>However, I do feel that putting my phone away in a drawer is still that much more inconvenient than just leaving it on the table, so I didn't manage to make that habit stick.
          <br><br>Instead, I’ve designed a Kindle & Phone stand that hides my phone behind the kindle, and as it gives my phone a proper "place" to be left it, I feel more inclined to leave it there, which made it easier to build the habit.
          <br><br>So far, I’ve seen a pretty significant decrease in the number of times that I pick up my phone just because I’m bored so I'll call it a success!
          <br><br>I've got another project coming soon that solves the same core problem!</p>

          <p class="p2">I'm in the midst of upgrading my desk area. I'm pretty proud of how far its come! The photos really don't do it justice, and I wish I could do a before and after, but I'm too lazy to tear everyone down and put it back up. <br><br>I'll start recording more of the little things from now on!</p>
